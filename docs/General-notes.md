## Convenience
The GliaWidgets iOS SDK provides a convenient entry point to using the core Glia SDK without having to do most of the UI related programming.

## Customization
The GliaWidgets iOS SDK allows customizing its colors, icons and text appearance via a custom Theme.

It is also possible to avoid creating a custom Theme in which case the Widgets will stay in their default appearance.
For example, chat default look:

<p align="center">
  <img width="500" src="./images/chat_general_look.png">
</p>

To read more about customization, navigate to the [Creating a Theme](creating-a-theme) page and other pages in the Customization section.

### UIImage
To be able to choose any icon's color, the asset used should be set to "Render as: Template Image". That applies to every image, color of which can be changed.
